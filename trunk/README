Gnoll is a free (as free speech) 3D action/rpg game engine still at an early 
development stage.
The source code, sounds, music, models and textures are respectively diffused 
under GPL and Free Art licences. 

You can contact the development team at:
Gnoll Devel <gnoll-devel@gna.org>

======================================
Building Gnoll
======================================

In order to build Gnoll you will need these packages :
- Autotools
- g++
- libxml++2.6
- glibmm
- Ogre 3d 1.2.x 
- CEGUI 0.5.0

To build it, just launch these commands :
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make install


Currently the game uses media from the Ogre 3D SDK. So you need also to get 
the sdk and put the configuration files of Ogre 3D in the same directory than
the game binairies.
